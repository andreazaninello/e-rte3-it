# Textual Entailment with Natural Language Explanations:
The Italian e-RTE-3 Dataset

This is the ’e-RTE-3-it’ dataset, an enriched version of the Italian RTE-3 dataset, where each text-hypothesis pair, in 
addition to the ’entailment’, ’contradiction’, or ’neutrality’ label, has been enriched with an explanation for the label itself.
Moreover, the dataset includes the level of confidence with which the annotators could write the explanation, and in cases
where the annotators did not agree with the original label, an alternative label, along with an explanation for the new label.
